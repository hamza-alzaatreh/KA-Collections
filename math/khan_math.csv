For example  you may survey your friends about what tv show is most popular  but the small sample size will not give you an accurate idea of what ALL 6th graders like to watch. To do this you must survey a cross section of students from all around the country and all backgrounds.

But there can be other functions! For example  vector-valued functions can have two variables or more as outputs! Polar functions are graphed using polar coordinates  i.e.  they take an angle as an input and output a radius! Learn about these functions and how we apply the concepts of the derivative and the integral on them.

Thinking about multivariable functions,Multivariable calculus,x9cf34252,https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/thinking-about-multivariable-function,thinking-about-multivariable-function,The only thing separating multivariable calculus from ordinary calculus is this newfangled word "multivariable".  It means we will deal with functions whose inputs or outputs live in two or more dimensions.  Here we lay the foundations for thinking about and visualizing multivariable functions.
Derivatives of multivariable functions,Multivariable calculus,xb3d3f2ba,https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives,multivariable-derivatives,What does it mean to take the derivative of a function whose input lives in multiple dimensions?  What about when its output is a vector?  Here we go over many different ways to  extend the idea of a derivative to higher dimensions  including partial derivatives​  directional derivatives  the gradient  vector derivatives  divergence  curl  etc.
Applications of multivariable derivatives,Multivariable calculus,x56699651,https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives,applications-of-multivariable-derivatives,The tools of partial derivatives  the gradient  etc. can be used to optimize and approximate multivariable functions.  These are very useful in practice  and to a large extent this is why people study multivariable calculus.
Integrating multivariable functions,Multivariable calculus,x833b5150,https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/integrating-multivariable-functions,integrating-multivariable-functions,There are many ways to extend the idea of integration to multiple dimensions: Line integrals  double integrals  triple integrals  surface integrals  etc.  Each one lets you add infinitely many infinitely small values  where those values might come from points on a curve  points in an area  points on a surface  etc.    These are all very powerful tools  relevant to almost all real-world applications of calculus.  In particular  they are an invaluable tool in physics.

In Topic A  students initially use repeated addition to find the total from a number of equal groups (2.OA.4).  As students notice patterns  they let go of longer addition sentences in favor of more efficient multiplication facts (3.OA.1).  Lessons in Topic A move students’ Grade 2 work with arrays and repeated addition a step further by developing skip-counting rows as a strategy for multiplication.  Arrays become a cornerstone of the module.  Students use the language of multiplication as they understand what factors are and differentiate between the size of groups and the number of groups within a given context.  In this module  the factors 2   3   4   5   and  10 provide an entry point for moving into more difficult factors in later modules."  Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org

At this point  Module 1 instruction coupled with fluency practice in Module 2 has students well on their way to meeting the Grade 3 fluency expectation for multiplying and dividing within 100 (3.OA.7).  Module 3 extends the study of factors from 2  3  4   5  and 10 to include all units from  0 to 10   as well as multiples of 10 within 100.  Similar to the organization of Module 1   the introduction of new factors in Module 3 spreads across topics.

Learn about it here.
Coordinate plane,Geometry (all content),x39b0c5d5,https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home/geometry-coordinate-plane,geometry-coordinate-plane,We use coordinates to describe where something is. In geometry  coordinates say where points are on a grid we call the "coordinate plane".
Area and perimeter,Geometry (all content),xa805107c,https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home/geometry-area-perimeter,geometry-area-perimeter,Area and perimeter help us measure the size of 2D shapes.

Not only are right triangles cool in their own right (pun intended)  they are the basis of very important ideas in analytic geometry (the distance between two points in space) and trigonometry.

Analytic geometry,Geometry (all content),xaf60b762,https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home/analytic-geometry-topic,analytic-geometry-topic,In analytic geometry  also known as coordinate geometry  we think about geometric objects on the coordinate plane. For example  we can see that opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel by writing a linear equation for each side and seeing that the slopes are the same.
Geometric constructions,Geometry (all content),x2b70434f,https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home/geometric-constructions,geometric-constructions,We now have fancy computers to help us perfectly draw things  but have you ever wondered how people drew perfect circles or angle bisectors or perpendicular bisectors back in the day.  Well this tutorial will have you doing just as your grandparents did (actually  a little different since you'll still be using a computer to draw circles and lines with a virtual compass and straightedge).
