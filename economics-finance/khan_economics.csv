In this unit  we introduce concepts of opportunity costs and trade-offs  and illustrate these concepts by using the production possibilities curve. We then consider how different types of economies determine which goods and services to produce  how to produce them  and to whom to distribute them. This unit also covers why and how specialization and exchange increase the total output of goods and services  with a discussion of absolute and comparative advantage. Finally  we touch on the importance of property rights  the role of incentives in the functioning of free markets  and the principle of marginal analysis.

In this unit  you will begins the study of product markets  focusing on the supply and demand model.  Students will be introduced to the determinants of demand and supply  market equilibrium  and how changes in equilibrium occur when supply and demand change. Then  build on the supply and demand model to deepen your economics toolkit with the concepts of elasticity  consumer and producer surplus  and the impact of government policies.

Topics include an introdduction to the short-run production function  diminishing marginal returns  the link between productivity and costs  the relationships that exist among cost curves  long-run costs  economies and diseconomies of scale  profit maximization  and the behavior of firms in perfectly competitive markets in the short run and the long run.

We analyze the concept of derived demand  understand how a factor’s marginal product and the marginal revenue product affect the demand for the factor  and consider the role of factor prices in the allocation of scarce resources.  By studying the determination of factor prices  we gain an understanding of how the market determines the distribution of income and the sources of income inequality in a market economy.

We examine the conditions for allocative efficiency  using the marginal social benefit and marginal social cost principle  and the ways in which externalities  public goods  and the market distribution of income create market failures even in competitive free-market economies. In addition  we study the effectiveness of government policies such as subsidies  taxes  quantity controls  and public provision of goods and services  which are designed to correct market failures and achieve allocative efficiency.
