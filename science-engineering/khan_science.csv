One-dimensional motion,Physics,x4549128e,https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion,one-dimensional-motion,In this tutorial we begin to explore ideas of velocity and acceleration.  We do exciting things like throw things off cliffs (far safer on paper than in real life) and see how high a ball will fly in the air.
Two-dimensional motion,Physics,xb32c33a3,https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/two-dimensional-motion,two-dimensional-motion,You understand velocity and acceleration well in one-dimension.  Now we can explore scenarios that are even more fun.  With a little bit of trigonometry (you might want to review your basic trig  especially what sin and cos are)  we can think about whether a baseball can clear the "green monster" at Fenway Park.
