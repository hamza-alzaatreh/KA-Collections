This little pump is the size of your clenched fist and it never stops. Watch these videos to learn more about how the heart works  blood flow in arteries and veins  blood pressure  and lymphatics.
Circulatory system diseases,NCLEX-RN,xee2cdbc6,https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/nclex-rn/rn-cardiovascular-diseases,rn-cardiovascular-diseases,With the heart pumping 24/7  it’s crucial that things flow smoothly (pun intended!). Unfortunately  this isn’t always the case. The underlying reasons for circulatory system problems vary from your genes to your lifestyle. To combat this growing problem in the world  we need a better understanding of these diseases.

After 20 to 30 branch points  oxygen diffuses into the liquid around the alveoli and slips into your blood. Carbon dioxide travels from the blood to the air and leaves the body when you exhale. Learn more about the respiratory system in these videos!
Respiratory system diseases,NCLEX-RN,x5c6eec6c,https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/nclex-rn/rn-respiratory-system-diseases,rn-respiratory-system-diseases,Our lungs are composed of a bronchial tree (think of an upside down tree with millions of leaves)  blood vessels bringing blood in and out  and a protein-rich fluid that forms a matrix holding everything together! If any part of this well-balanced organ isn’t working properly  a person can be left feeling short of breath. The lungs are also exposed to the outside environment  making them prone to infections. To counter infections  the lungs are lined with cells that have tiny protein bristles which wave back and forth and can literally sweep away dangerous bacteria. Learn more about diseases of the lungs and how modern medicine helps to keep them healthy!

Endocrine system physiology,NCLEX-RN,x27c57698,https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/nclex-rn/rn-endocrine-system,rn-endocrine-system,You can’t really point to any single organ as “the endocrine system ” because it’s actually a family of glands that secrete hormones into the body. Hormones travel through the bloodstream to interact with specific target cells and organs. This signaling system helps to keep the entire body well-balanced and on the same page.
Endocrine system diseases,NCLEX-RN,x5757eba6,https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/nclex-rn/rn-endocrine-system-diseases,rn-endocrine-system-diseases,The most common endocrine system disease is Diabetes Mellitus.

This disease can cause problems with kidneys  eyesight  circulatory dysregulation  and more.
Lymphatic system physiology,NCLEX-RN,x0387b39d,https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/nclex-rn/rn-lymphatic-system,rn-lymphatic-system,Your heart pumps about 20 L of blood a day through your body. The plasma component of blood leaks out through capillaries and is mostly reabsorbed. However  about 3 L of the plasma is left behind in fluid surrounding tissues  and it is the job of the hard-working lymphatic system to bring back this fluid to the circulatory system.
Immune system physiology,NCLEX-RN,x53dd26d4,https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/nclex-rn/rn-immune-system,rn-immune-system,Chances are you’ve had a fever or a cough before.
